# Electricity

In Project Stellaris, a lot of machines need to be powered by Electricity.

## Generators

The mod contains multiple blocks that can generate electricity

| Blocks                |      Use                      |  Max Generation (Fe/Tick)|
| --------------------- | :---------------------------: | ----: |
| Solar Panel           | Need to be set under the sun  | 1     |
| Radioactive Generator |   Need Radioactive blocks     | 500   |



## Power other machines

Now that you have electricity, you need to power other machines. For this, there are two ways :

- First, you can set a generator next to a machine

- You can also use a cable

::: info
The `Generators blocks` and `Machines` from Stellaris are compatible with other tech mods.
